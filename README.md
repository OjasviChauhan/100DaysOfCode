# 100DaysOfCode
## Day 1 : 23rd April 2020
Started to study Solidity language which is use to implement Smart Contracts in Ethereum Blockchain and wrote some codes of the same.

Link for Repository : [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/OjasviChauhan/Smart-Contracts).
## Day 2 : 24th April 2020
Studied Servlets from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wty6OROO__8&list=PLsyeobzWxl7pUPF2xjjJiG4BKC9x_GY46&index=6) video & Created one on Eclipse IDE and configured web.xml.   
This web app is just to simply add two numbers on the server without using Javascript. Here I've just used a simple code in the servlet to create the same.

## Day 3 : 25th April 2020
Studied Data Structures in Solidity from [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.6/structure-of-a-contract.html) and wrote some codes for them to create few Contracts.

## Day 4 : 26th April 2020
Created a basic Login Web-App using Servlets with the help of Eclipse IDE and deployed on Apache Tomcat Server 9.0.

## Day 5 : 27th April 2020
Studied about Time units in Solidity and variable called "Now" from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts/lecture/8lLMG/data-structures-part-2-statetransv2-demo) and created a smart contract called StateTrans.sol and tested it on [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Day 6 : 28th April 2020
Studied about Queues and Stack classes in Java and solved some problems from HackerRank under section "30 Days of Code". Click [here](https://github.com/OjasviChauhan/HackerRank-30-Days-of-Code/blob/master/Day%2018:%20Queues%20and%20Stacks.java) to view the solution.

Studied about JDBC-ODBC drivers and learnt how to connect database to a web application and fetch data from server to store in database.
## Day 7 : 29th April 2020
Studied Access Modifiers and Applications in Solidity and created few contracts using these concepts.

Link for Repository : [Solidity Codes](https://github.com/OjasviChauhan/Smart-Contracts/tree/master/Solidity%20Codes)
## Day 8 : 30th April 2020
Studied Time Elements in Solidity from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts/lecture/IsmQt/time-elements-part-1) and implemented the concept in a contract.
Link for Repository : [Solidity Codes](https://github.com/OjasviChauhan/Smart-Contracts/tree/master/Solidity%20Codes).

Learnt about "Metamask" which is a crypto Wallet that act as a gateway to blockchain apps and learnt how to connect a smart contract to RinkeBy Ethereum test network and adding some ethers to the account.
